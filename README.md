## Intro to Identity


### Directions
1. Create a new project in the problem domain of your choice (don't use the same example we are using in class)
2. This project should  evolve to a point where it will eventually have parts of the site that are restricted for specifc types of users (i.e. Admins, Members etc...)
3. For Today's lab
  - Create an initial project starting from an empty project
  - Set it up to include MVC with a default home route
  - Make minimum functionality for the site to work as expect as stand-alone (i.e. My site was able to add content to the home page through a CMS)
 4. Add Identity to your site.
  - Inlcude the DBContext in the Startup class
  - Make sure the Database is created with the mininum identity tables
  - ASP.NET Core Identity should be succesfully implemented by the time you are finshed.
  
  - **Stretch** - If you complete your lab before lecture, do some research on registering a user. See if you are able to implement this logic, and see how it compares to the way we do it in class.
